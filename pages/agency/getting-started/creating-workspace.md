# Creating your workspace

Welcome! We appreciate your interest in Pressto. The following guide will help you hit the ground running with our PRM tool.

## Step 1: Create workspace

To begin, please go to [login.heypressto.ai](https://login.heypressto.ai) using your preferred web browser. Click on "Sign Up" to create a new workspace and account. Follow the steps to set your workspace up.

### Workspace name

The workspace name is the name of your PR agency or company. This will be used as the subdomain for your workspace. For example, if you input "My Workspace" as your workspace name, your workspace URL will be "my-workspace.heypressto.ai".

### Profile

The profile is the name of the user who will be the primary administrator of the workspace. This is the person who will be responsible for managing the workspace and its users. Email addresses are unique across all workspaces, so if you are creating a new workspace, you will need to use a different email address from the one you used to sign up for another workspace.

### Invite your team

At the heart of every PR agency are the strategists and managers. On Pressto, you are provided with a user-friendly interface to add and manage team members.

To add team members:

1. Click "Add your first team member"
2. Input their name and email address
3. Designate their role (e.g., agency manager or client)
4. An invitation email will be sent to them automatically

They simply have to accept the invite and set up their profile to become active members of your workspace.

### Add clients

Once you have added your team members, you can add your clients:

1. Click "Add your first client"
2. Fill out the client details including:
   - Client name
   - Tags (relevant to their industry and likely news mentions)
   - Address
   - Boilerplate description
   - Service scope
3. Upload the client's logo
4. Add spokespeople information
5. Add client employees (optional)
6. Assign agency managers to the client

_Important Note: If you add a client to the Employee section, they will be invited to their Pressto client page and will be able to see their news for the day, activities in their planner, and coverage. Skip this step if you're not ready to invite clients to your Pressto workspace._

_Tip: If you're in a hurry, just add the client name, tags and city. You can update everything else later._
