Your new user will receive an email with a link to set up their account.

_Tip: If they didn't receive the invitation or the link has expired, you can click Resend Invite._

**Once a user has been added,** click Edit and assign them clients from the dropdown list.

_Tip: If their client doesn't exist, you'll need to create a new client. You can assign team members to clients on the add client page or on client profile pages._
