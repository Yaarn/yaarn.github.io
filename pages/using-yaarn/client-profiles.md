# Hiding Analysis from Clients

You may want to hide the sentiment analysis and competitor analysis from certain or all clients. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this.

## Hiding Analysis for All Clients

1. Navigate to **Settings → Users → Advanced Options → Roles**
2. Click on the **Client role** to modify permissions
3. Untick the boxes for "Can view competitor analysis" and "Can view client sentiment"

### Hiding Analysis for Specific Clients

If you want to hide these analyses only from specific clients, you will need to create a new role.

1. From the **Roles** page, click "Add Role"
2. Name your new role and assign the desired permissions, ensuring that "Can view competitor analysis" and "Can view client sentiment" remain unticked.
3. Go back to the **Settings → Users** page found under the left-hand navigation bar.
4. Click **Edit** for each user that you want to assign the new role to, then select the new role from the dropdown menu.

_Note: These settings can always be adjusted later if needed._
